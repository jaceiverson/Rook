One of my most ambitious (and currently in the process of being completed)
projects ever. I grew up playing the game of Rook with my family, and 
wanted to make a game where you could play over the local network. The
idea spurred from when spending time at my parents cabin (during the 
covid lockdown) I wanted to play rook, but didn't know if other people
would be comfortable playing cards with everything that was going on. 
I did a lot of programing to get the game logic where it is accurate, 
then came the working on the network play. This is what is still in
progress. However, it is no fun to play a 4 player game all on the same 
computer seeing each others' cards, so I have yet to play this with my
family. 

**Ambition goals for the future of this project**<br>
I would like to host this game on a server, that I inherited, and be able
to play with family throughout the country. 

_card-img_<br>
stores the individual card images as well as the card back image

_rook_tests and socket_tests_<br>
stores the attempts I had at making classes and functions that went
into the final project as well as my lame attempts at creating a network
socket to play the game on. I have learned a lot since then a lot of that
code is just copied and pasted from the internet hopping it would work. :) 

_tutorial files_<br>
stores work I followed to learn more about sockets. Thanks Tech with Tim
for helping understand how to send and receive data from sockets, as well
as use of the buttons to send certain data. This is going to be pivotal
in the completion of this project (I hope).

 _game.py_<br>
 This is the file that runs the game and will eventually what the server
 will run to start the game
 
 _rook_deck.py_<br>
 this is a dictionary of all the cards in Rook.
 
 _teamMaker_<br>
 creates random teams with the 4 names (user input) if prompted to do so.
 will be replaced for manual entry from the sockets once implemented.

 Thanks and enjoy.
